# Lambda Prompt
My prefered zsh prompt

## Installation
Install `bluedragon1221/zsh-lambda-prompt` with your favorite zsh-plugin manager.

## Configuration
Currently, there are two configuration options.

`$CURSOR_BEAM` determines if you want the prompt to override the cursor shape.
This will also keep the cursor a beam after you open a program that changes it (like neovim).
`1` to enable, or `0` to disable

`$DIR_HASHES` determines if you want some default DIR_HASHES.
These are like mapped locations in starship.
`1` to enable, or `0` to disable
